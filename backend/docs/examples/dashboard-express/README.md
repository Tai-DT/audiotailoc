# Dashboard API - Express Example

A minimal Express implementation of the Dashboard API described in the OpenAPI specification in ../openapi/dashboard.yaml.

Requirements
- Node >= 18

Install

```bash
npm install
```

Run

```bash
npm start
```

Run tests

```bash
npm test

Notes
- This is a small example to demonstrate API patterns, input validation, CORS, rate limiting, logging and basic auth middleware. Replace the auth middleware with real JWT validation in production.
