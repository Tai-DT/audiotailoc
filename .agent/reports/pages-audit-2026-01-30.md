## Notes

1. **Sample Data Fallbacks**: All new pages include sample/mock data that displays when the API is unavailable, ensuring the UI is always functional for testing.

2. **Cart Hook Integration**: The `/deals` page integrates with the existing `useCart` hook for "Add to Cart" functionality.

3. **Search Integration**: `/brands`, `/guides`, `/news`, `/reviews` all include search functionality.

4. **Newsletter**: Connects to `/newsletter/subscribe` endpoint (can be implemented on backend).

5. **Order Tracking**: Uses `/orders/track/:code` endpoint (may need backend implementation).

---

## Recommendations

1. **Backend Endpoints to Create:**
   - `POST /newsletter/subscribe` - Newsletter registration
   - `GET /orders/track/:code` - Order tracking by code
   - `GET /support/guides` - Guides listing
   - `GET /testimonials` - Customer testimonials

2. **SEO Improvements:**
   - Add dynamic metadata to each page
   - Create XML sitemap at `/sitemap.xml`
   - Add structured data (JSON-LD) for products and reviews

3. **Analytics:**
   - Track page views for new pages
   - Monitor user flows through comparison and tracking features
