## üîß VALIDATION LOGIC

### Input Validation Patterns

```typescript
// Email Validation
const EMAIL_PATTERN = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;

// Vietnamese Phone
const VN_PHONE_PATTERN = /^(0|84)(3|5|7|8|9)[0-9]{8}$/;

// Order Number
const ORDER_NUMBER_PATTERN = /^ORD-\d{8}-[A-Z0-9]{5}$/;

// Slug Format
const SLUG_PATTERN = /^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$/;

// Vietnamese Name
const VN_NAME_PATTERN = /^[a-zA-Z√Ä-·ªπƒêƒë\s]+$/;
```

### Price Calculation Logic

```typescript
function calculateOrderTotal(items, shipping, discount) {
  const subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => 
    sum + (item.price * item.quantity), 0
  );
  
  const shippingFee = subtotal >= 1000000 ? 0 : shipping;
  const discountAmount = Math.min(discount, subtotal * 0.3);
  const tax = (subtotal - discountAmount) * 0.1; // 10% VAT
  
  return {
    subtotal,
    shippingFee,
    discountAmount,
    tax,
    total: subtotal + shippingFee - discountAmount + tax
  };
}
```

### Stock Validation Logic

```typescript
function validateStock(product, requestedQty) {
  const rules = {
    canOrder: product.stock >= requestedQty,
    isLowStock: product.stock < 10,
    isOutOfStock: product.stock === 0,
    maxOrderQty: Math.min(product.stock, 99),
    message: ''
  };
  
  if (rules.isOutOfStock) {
    rules.message = 'S·∫£n ph·∫©m ƒë√£ h·∫øt h√†ng';
  } else if (!rules.canOrder) {
    rules.message = `Ch·ªâ c√≤n ${product.stock} s·∫£n ph·∫©m`;
  } else if (rules.isLowStock) {
    rules.message = 'S·∫Øp h·∫øt h√†ng';
  }
  
  return rules;
}
```

### Date/Time Validation Logic

```typescript
function validateBookingDate(date, service) {
  const rules = {
    isValid: true,
    message: ''
  };
  
  const now = new Date();
  const bookingDate = new Date(date);
  const hoursDiff = (bookingDate - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
  
  // Min 24 hours advance
  if (hoursDiff < 24) {
    rules.isValid = false;
    rules.message = 'ƒê·∫∑t tr∆∞·ªõc √≠t nh·∫•t 24 gi·ªù';
  }
  
  // Max 30 days advance
  if (hoursDiff > 24 * 30) {
    rules.isValid = false;
    rules.message = 'Ch·ªâ ƒë·∫∑t tr∆∞·ªõc t·ªëi ƒëa 30 ng√†y';
  }
  
  // Check working hours (8-18)
  const hour = bookingDate.getHours();
  if (hour < 8 || hour >= 18) {
    rules.isValid = false;
    rules.message = 'Gi·ªù l√†m vi·ªác 8:00 - 18:00';
  }
  
  // Check holidays
  if (isPublicHoliday(bookingDate)) {
    rules.isValid = false;
    rules.message = 'Kh√¥ng l√†m vi·ªác ng√†y l·ªÖ';
  }
  
  return rules;
}
```
